                <p>
                    A Broforce inspired micro-project built to explore reaction-based AI systems.
                    The goal was to create a system of cascading interactions involving environmental
                    damage and agent responses. The AI graphs demanded careful architectural structure. I used my node
                    editor, Flow Grid, to keep all behaviour logic organized and manageable.

                        <strong>Chain Reactions:</strong>
                        A single bullet can trigger an entire cascade. It hits a barrel,
                        which explodes and ignites the fuse timers of nearby barrels.
                        Fire spreads across tiles based on probability, burning through structures
                        and causing collapse. Barrels without support fall and detonate on impact.
                        Enemies caught in the blast may survive but catch fire, causing them to panic
                        and run back and forth, sometimes falling off ledges. They normally patrol and enter an
                        alert state when the player is nearby. The whole level behaves as one system,
                        with destruction and fire cascading naturally through the environment.

                        <strong>Cross-Object Communication:</strong>
                        The core challenge was managing communication between objects. Barrels, tiles, enemies, and the
                        player could all trigger one another through reaction chains, which quickly became too complex
                        for traditional script references. To solve this, each object broadcasts and receives event
                        signals through its node graph, allowing reactions to cascade cleanly across the entire level
                        without hard-coded links. This architecture kept the system organized and manageable.
