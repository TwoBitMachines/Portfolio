                    is a 2D hack-and-slash featuring a complete combat loop, a
                    multi-stage boss, diverse enemies, dialogue interactions, and a coin-based shop system. I led
                    development, handling core gameplay programming, level design support, and animation integration.
                    This project also served as a proof of concept for Flare engine.

                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li> <strong>Combat & AI:</strong> The player can perform a four-stage melee combo by purchasing
                        upgrades from a vendor. Enemy AI includes basic patrol and chase behaviors, slam attacks, and
                        flying enemies that follow Bezier curves to swoop and strike. The most complex AI is the boss,
                        which can grab and damage the player and switch between multiple attack patterns. Its logic was
                        implemented using a custom tree-based node editor built for Flare, as the behavior was too
                        intricate to manage with a standard AI FSM.
                    </li>

                    <li> <strong>Core Systems And Challenges:</strong> I used Flare’s built-in systems for dialogue
                        triggers, conversation trees, AI, visual effects such as blood shaders, and camera control. The
                        vendor UI required custom code for placement and navigation.
                        The save system proved to be the most challenging part of the project. Coordinating state across
                        health, coins, enemy AI, and world persistence was more complex than expected. Dying without
                        saving at the vendor meant losing coins and respawning enemies, so the system had to carefully
                        restore or reset each component based on checkpoint state.
                    </li>

                    <li> <strong>Project Management:</strong> As project lead, I coordinated a remote team across
                        multiple time zones, working with an artist, a composer, and a level designer. Communication was
                        handled primarily through Discord for discussion and asset delivery.
                        I organized tasks, set realistic scope boundaries, and kept development on track under tight
                        production constraints. Managing time zone differences and limited development time was the main
                        challenge, but clear communication and careful task planning allowed the project to be completed
                        successfully.</li>
