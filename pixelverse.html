                    This is a full-featured pixel art editor built for creating sprites and animations directly inside
                    Unity. Pixel art workflows normally require constant context switching between Unity and external
                    tools like Aseprite or Photoshop. Even small changes involve export and reimport steps, which slows
                    iteration and breaks creative flow.
                    <br><br>
                    Pixelverse removes this friction by embedding a complete pixel art editor directly into the Unity
                    Editor. Artists work with familiar tools such as layers, palettes, animation timelines, and drawing
                    tools without leaving Unity. Each asset can be linked to a dedicated export folder, allowing
                    one-click exports to PNG, GIF, or texture arrays and significantly improving iteration speed.

                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>The Core Challenge:</strong> Unity’s built-in serialization handles large arrays poorly,
                        especially raw color data, resulting in excessive memory usage. Even simple sprites can grow to
                        several megabytes. I addressed this by implementing a custom Run-Length Encoding (RLE) system
                        that compresses repeated pixels into a compact byte array that Unity serializes efficiently.
                        Combined with a Job System pass to process the data, this reduced memory usage from megabytes to
                        kilobytes while maintaining smooth performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Job System for Editor Performance:</strong> Operations on large pixel arrays, such as
                        bucket fill, flip, and rotate, can easily freeze the editor. These operations were offloaded to
                        Unity’s Job System, keeping the editor responsive even with large canvases.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Advanced Technical Features:</strong> I implemented a custom undo/redo system to
                        efficiently track pixel-level changes, as Unity’s built-in undo system cannot handle real-time
                        texture editing. The editor also supports quick selection and movement of pixels while painting.
                        Additionally, I built an IK system for pixel art to enable smooth procedural movement, which is
                        rarely supported in pixel-based workflows.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Custom Editor UI:</strong> The entire interface was built using Unity’s Editor API,
                        including a custom color wheel (RGB, HSV, and HSL), layer and palette management, tool
                        selection, an animation timeline with live preview, automatic frame cropping, canvas resizing,
                        and folder-based asset organization.</li>

                    <li><strong>Other:</strong> Marquee selection, Bresenham line, circle, and square drawing,
                        interpolated brush smoothing for gap-free strokes, and extensive shortcut support for painting,
                        erasing, and timeline navigation.
                    </li>
